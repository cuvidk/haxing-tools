Scripts used to rapidly setup an arch system that includes a bunch of tools for web hacking. It also includes a Dockerfile which generates a docker image which can be used for the same purpose.

### TODO:
- after installing dnsvalidator, add a cronjob which runs update_resolvers.sh periodically. Upload the new output to github
- make arch AUR packages for all of these (in the future).
